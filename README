Please make sure you dont have any previous versions of the mod installed.
No need to rename anything, just download and unpack.

Installation: download modpack, put it into your mods directory.
Go to /games/minetest_game/mods  and delete /creative folder from there. You wont need it anymore (if you omit this step you will suffer glitches).

IMPORTANT: you need to run Minetest 0.4.4 at least.

Please post any ideas you may have to help improve it.
